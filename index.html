<h2> Background Information to DFTA and Ageism</h2>
  <p> As Commissioner Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez states in her <a href = "https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dfta/about/commissioners-message.page"> message </a>, the NYC DFTA, or the New York City Department For The Aging aims to “eliminate ageism and ensure the dignity and quality of life of diverse older adults.” Ageism, the discrimination and sterotype against individuals based on age, is a serious social problem presented in our current society. It's also a form of discrimination that is very overlooked in society. According to <a href = "https://www.who.int/westernpacific/news/q-a-detail/ageing-ageism"> The World Health Organization, </a> "ageism serves a social and economic purpose: to legitimize and sustain inequalities between groups. It’s not about how we look, but about how people that have influence assign meaning to how we look." In a technologically advanced setting that favors the younger generation that cities, such as New York City revolve around, there are recurring problems for seniors and older people. They are often treated with disrespect and are given a lack of proper care/attention. 
  </p>

<br>

<h2>The Role/Makeup of the DFTA and Programs</h2>
<p>The Commissioner states that she and others part of the NYC DFTA aim to resolve and give attention to such problems by supporting caregivers as well as partnering with many organizations that are community-based, including senior centers. The Advisory Council also supports the department and the Commissioner consisting of 31 members. 10 members, two from each borough represent diversity, and 16 members from nonprofit organizations that aim to support elderly/older NYC people. From 2019 in which they launched their awareness campaign for unpaid caregivers throughout the city, they were able to launch a contact center for families called the Aging Connect in 2020. </p>
<p> The funding that the DFTA provides supports around 250 senior centers and partnerships. These funds provide availability for activities and more for seniors that include dance,technology class, transportation, art, music, yoga, self managements, and lunch. Senior centers can also be found through boroughs and ZIP codes on <a href = "https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dfta/index.page"> this </a> website, and may further be narrowed down to service types. Friendly visiting and home services are also offered which include personal care, housekeeping, counseling and meal delivery. Caregiver Programs are also supported through the DFTA as well as Health Insurance Assistance which includes Medicare and discussion about what plans are right for seniors to take. Volunteers who meet the criteria which takes part in wanting to make a difference in the life of older adults or the other way around, the DFTA Volunteer Interest is available. Health Care Coverage and Insurance Guidances are offered through HIICAP, a free Department for Aging resource. Senior Employment opportunities are available through the SESU, experienced in placing older adults in various jobs with training and opportunities. </p>

<h2> COVID-19's toll on Older Adults and the Elder Abuse Campaign 
</h2>
<p>COVID-19 has also served as an emotional and physical impact to older adults. Seniors are at the highest risk because of their age, and often times, they don't know how to ask for help in times of struggle. The DFTA provides Food Assistance for emergency food necessity delivery to seniors. Health and Safety services are further provided which include mental health help and support, medical and medication supplies and delivery,  Medicare, and health insurance assistance. As the pandemic continues, the DFTA encourages seniors to use their availability and helpline to ask for help and speak up. </p>
<p>Domestic violence within elder abuse happens frequently. The DFTA also has a elder abuse advertising campaign which encourages all older adults to speak out instead of suffering in silence. Victims of abuse either financially, physically or even emotionally can speak out and these victims can be provided with crisis intervention as well as safety planning. Agencies also connect elderly victims with clinicians who help treat mental health and more. PROTECT, or Providing Options to Elderly Clients Together set up by the DFTA offers such mental health support. The Elderly Crime Victims Resource Center further helps to give service and support to elderly victims of crime that can be physical, emotional, or financial as many elderly are targeted for money. In general, the DFTA helps to provide a way for seniors to remain socially and mentally connected with the rest of the world, reminding them that they have the right to speak up. </p>
